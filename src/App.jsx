          <h2>2. Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            We designed Postix to make it easy for you to create engaging social media content. This Privacy Policy
            outlines the types of information we may collect, how we use it, and the steps we take to protect it while

          <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We collect limited data to improve Postix and understand how it’s being used. The data we collect is
            gathered through Google Analytics, a third-party analytics service. Specifically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: When you use Postix, Google Analytics collects information such as:
              <ul>
                <li>Device information (e.g., type of device, operating system).</li>
                <li>App usage statistics (e.g., how often the app is opened, which features are used most).</li>
                <li>Approximate location (derived from IP address, but not precise geolocation).</li>
                <li>Other anonymized data to track trends and performance.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information</strong>: Postix does not require you to sign up with an account, and we
              do not collect personally identifiable information like your name, email address, or the specific quotes
              you generate unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., through feedback or support inquiries).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to collect this data. For more details on how Google
            handles this information, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"

        <section>
          <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>We use the data collected through Google Analytics solely to improve Postix and enhance your experience.
            Specifically, we use it to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Monitor app performance and identify areas for improvement.</li>
            <li>Understand how many active users we have and how they interact with the app.</li>
            <li>Detect and fix bugs or technical issues.</li>
            <li>Analyze trends to make Postix more efficient and user-friendly.</li>
          </ul>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
          <p>We do not share your data with anyone. The information collected via Google Analytics is used exclusively
            by the Postix team for the purposes outlined above and is not disclosed to third parties beyond Google
            Analytics itself, which processes the data on our behalf.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Your Control Over Your Data</h2>
          <p>Since Postix does not collect personal information or require an account, your control over data is
            primarily managed through your device settings. You can limit or disable data collection by Google Analytics
            by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adjusting your device’s privacy settings (e.g., disabling analytics or ad tracking).</li>
            <li>Using tools provided by Google, such as the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"
                                                               target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google
              Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
